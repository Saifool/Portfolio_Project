# SQL DATA EXPLORATION
I have done some data exploration using SQL. This is my frist part of my SQL protfolio project. 
Here I have practised SQL query on Covid death and vaccination data from 'Our world in data' and link: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths (Note: Data in the link regularly updated).
Skills used: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types.
